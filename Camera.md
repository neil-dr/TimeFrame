`server/utils/camera_manager.py` line `10`
```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```
the argument 0 is the camera index â€” it tells OpenCV which camera device to open.

## ðŸŽ¥ How camera indices work
- 0 â†’ the default (usually built-in) camera
- 1 â†’ the first external USB or virtual camera
- 2, 3, etc. â†’ additional connected cameras

In order to see all camera indexes use `ffmpeg`
```
brew install ffmpeg
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""
```
Youâ€™ll get something like:
```
[AVFoundation video devices]:
[0] FaceTime HD Camera
[1] USB Camera
```
â†’ So youâ€™d use cv2.VideoCapture(1) to open the USB Camera.
